content: "<p>I am having the Chrome for iOS issue listed here. I have full size photos
  that use 100vh and 100vw, but when I scroll up and down, the address bar appearing
  and disappearing causes some horrible scrolly jank on the page. It seems fine on
  mobile Safari, I guess I have the opposite problem to you! Or at least more like
  the font size issue. I have no idea what to do to stop it screwing up on Chrome
  for iOSâ€¦</p>"
