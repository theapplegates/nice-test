content: "<p>Thanks for compiling this information. I was trying having a similar
  problem, but was able to solve my issues by using css fixed position elements for
  the parts of the page that you want to stick at the top and bottom. You'll be glad
  to hear that at least Safari on IOS positions them at the top and the bottom of
  the visible area, rather than at the top and bottom of their calculated viewport
  (even when top and bottom browser bars appear and disappear when scrolling).</p>"
