content: "<p>I get really annoyed with mobile browsers in general, the viewport size
  changing on scroll is so ugly, when I use something that has vh it makes the whole
  page jump up and down when I scroll and the address bar shows up for instance. The
  viewport in mobile browsers should always be at a fixed height in my opinion. If
  that means always showing the address bar and other bars and sacrificing some screen
  real estate, so be it. Phones are becoming so huge anyway that 40px less height
  in a browser really isn't a big deal.</p>"
