Awesome (old) post by [Chris Taylor](https://www.stillbreathing.co.uk/about) about progressive enhancement, seen as [Technical Credit](https://www.stillbreathing.co.uk/2016/10/13/technical-credit):

> With such a wide array of both expected and unexpected properties of the current technological revolution, building our systems in such a way to both be resilient to potential failures and benefit from unanticipated events surely is a no-brainer.

Unfortunately, it seems most people working in Web development, at least outside our [Web quality standards](https://www.opquast.com/20120531web-quality-ux-best-practices/) bubble, don't seem to grok the importance of progressive enhancement.
