> What catches my eye are the gaps between TTFB and the paint metrics, and between the paint metrics and First CPU Idle. These gaps are caused by **JavaScript dominating the browser main thread**. This happens after TTFB when all the blocking scripts are executed â€“ these have to finish before any rendering can happen.

Emphasis is mine.

We really need to be more careful with the way we use JavaScript, and JavaScript libraries/framework, that more than often hurts performance.
