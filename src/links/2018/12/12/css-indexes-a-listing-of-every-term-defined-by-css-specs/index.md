> This is a non-normative document. It lists **every term defined in CSS**, as long as itâ€™s marked up correctly for the spec generator. It is intended as a reference document for authors, implementors, and spec authors, to aid in finding the definition for a term hidden somewhere in the haystack of CSS specs.
