I love this really didactic talk about focus styles:

> Focus styles don't have to be ugly! Focus styles are an integral part of any mature design system. This talk will discuss the intersection of WCAG compliance and Inclusive Design, as well as new focus-related CSS selectors. Additionally, strategies for how to effectively implement them in your organization will be discussed.

I also love how [Notist](https://noti.st/) allows talk authors to write the transcript alongside each slide. Very useful when there is no video, or for people with visual disabilities.
