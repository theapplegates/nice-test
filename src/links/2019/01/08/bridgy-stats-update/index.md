I've been using [Brid.gy](https://brid.gy) since [I started using Webmentions](/2017/07/so-long-disqus-hello-webmentions.html) on this site, to get mentions from silos (Twitter mostly) back to the contents. This is an awesome service.

> Since launch in December 2013: 3793 users, 1.22M webmentions sent successfully to almost 2000 unique domains, 12.8M responses handled (likes, comments etc), 42K POSSEs published

This shows how small the IndieWeb community is, but I hope we will be much more in a few years.

> total cost back down to ~$.01/user/month (from ~$.02 a year ago)

It doesn't seem a lot obviously, but if volumes increase (users and content), Ryan might need funding.

I searched for a way to help with these expenses, but [Bridgy asks to back IndieWeb](https://brid.gy/about#cost) instead. [I'm already backing IndieWeb](https://opencollective.com/indieweb?referral=2747) every month, so I guess it's good.
