Jeremy Keith explains how he built [the timeline](https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/timeline/) of inspirations and achievements of the World Wide Web:

> I thought it would be interesting not only to look at what’s happened between 1989 and 2019, but also to look at what happened between 1959 and 1989.
> 
> So now I’ve got two time cones that converge in the middle: 1959 – 1989 and 1989 – 2019. For the first time period, I made categories of influences: formats, hypertext, networks, and computing. For the second time period, I catalogued notable results: browsers, servers, and the evolution of HTML.
