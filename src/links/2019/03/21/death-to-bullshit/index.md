> We’re bombarded by more information than ever before. With the rise of all this information comes a rise of the amount of bullshit we’re exposed to. Death to Bullshit is a rallying cry to rid the world of bullshit and demand experiences that respect people and their time.

Brad Frost gave a great talk at Creative Mornings in Pittsburgh in April 2013:

{% vimeo 63437853 %}

He then built [a Death To Bullshit website and blog](http://deathtobullshit.com/) with his brother [Ian Frost](http://ianfrostweather.com/), demoing the crap we put in most our websites nowadays.

Unfortunately, we didn't get better along the years…

> we as creators have a decision to make: do we want to be part of the 90% of noise out there, or do we want to be part of the 10% of signal?
