Yuan Chuan creates art from everything available in CSS, created [`< css-doodle />`](https://css-doodle.com/) (a web component for drawing patterns with CSS), and gave a talk at the [5th CSS Conference in Shenzhen](https://css.w3ctech.com/5) on March 30, 2019.

Here is the video recording (also [on the conference website](https://www.yuque.com/cssconf/5th/hyku3f#1f2bd521)):

Yuan Chuan presents in Chinese, but the slides and even some live coding are already awesome and self-describing.

Unfortunately, some features are not yet available in some browsers, so to really enjoy the presentation, you must use [Google Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/intl/fr_ALL/chrome/canary/), the version for developers.

If you want to deep dive in the code, [the source of the presentation is on Github](https://github.com/yuanchuan/talk/tree/gh-pages/generative-art-with-css).

You can also find some of [Yuan Chuan's experiments on CodePen](https://codepen.io/yuanchuan/).
