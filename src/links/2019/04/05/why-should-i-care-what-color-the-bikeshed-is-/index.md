> The really, really short answer is that you should not. The somewhat longer answer is that just because you are capable of building a bikeshed does not mean you should stop others from building one just because you do not like the color they plan to paint it.

"Bikeshedding" was coined as a metaphor of [Parkinson's law of triviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality) by Poul-Henning Kamp, known for his work on popular open source projects like [FreeBSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD) (Free Berkeley Software Distribution) and [Varnish cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varnish_cache).
