If you don't know yet how to do Web layout with CSS, or feel like struggling with it, this great (baby) step by step tutorial will help you a lot:

> You can spend hours trying random CSS properties, copying and pasting from Stack Overflow, and hoping to stumble upon that magical combination that will produce the layout you want.
> 
> If your usual strategy is to approach layout in an item-by-item way – put A over here, and now that A is in its place, I want to put B over there… well, **that’s a guaranteed route to frustration**. CSS doesn’t work like Sketch or Photoshop.
> 
> In this post I want to show you a way to approach layouts wholistically, as **a cohesive problem to be solved**.

> We’ll go through a small example, start to finish, and **I’ll explain all the CSS along the way** […]

Really brilliant!
