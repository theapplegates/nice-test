Andy and Heydon teach us CSS layout with modern standards, what they call "[algorithmic layout design](https://every-layout.dev/blog/algorithmic-design/)":

> Employing algorithmic layout design means doing away with @media breakpoints, “magic numbers”, and other hacks, to create context-independent layout components. Your future design systems will be more consistent, terser in code, and more malleable in the hands of your users and their devices.

Great source of inspiration for future projects.
