Publishing a draft originally written in 2015, Remy shows Progressive Enhancement is still a strong topic all developers should understand and work on:

> Developers are inherently lazy. It's what makes them/us optimise our workflows and become very good at solving problems. We re-use what's known to work and tend to eke out the complex parts that we can "live without". Sadly, **this can be at the cost of accessibility and progressive enhancement.**

> [â€¦]
> 
> Since JavaScript doesn't exhibit the same resilience that HTML & CSS does, so the fear is that it'll leave users who can't upgrade, faced with a broken or blank page.
