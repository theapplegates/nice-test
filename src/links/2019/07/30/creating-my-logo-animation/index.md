Cassie Evans shares the multiple steps involved in the creation of the lovely animated logo of her personal website:

> There's a few things going on in this logo animation. We've got
>
> - SVG stroke animation
> - SVG Clip-path
> - Greensock for the animation
> - Greensock's Custom Bounce, and Draw SVG plugins
> - and a *whole* load of drawing stuff out in illustrator.

Looks like I could find some useful inspiration when I finally work on [esviji](https://esviji.com/) v3â€¦
