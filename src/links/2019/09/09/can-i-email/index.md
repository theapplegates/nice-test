Rémy and a few others launched an awesome resource for people who plan to struggle with rich email using HTML and CSS, which are not well supported in most email clients.

Inspired by the famous "[Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/)" I visit at least once a week, it's logically named "Can I Email ___ ?"

> So far, we have more than 50 HTML and CSS features tested across 25 emails clients. And we’ve got a lot more coming up in the following weeks and months.
