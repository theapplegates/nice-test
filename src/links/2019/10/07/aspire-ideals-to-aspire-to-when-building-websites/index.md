Just like Scott says, "the types of sites I personally want to see on the web aim to excel at these qualities":

> - **A**ccessible
> - **S**ecure
> - **P**erformant
> - **I**nclusive
> - **R**esponsive
> - **E**thical

People answered the thread on Twitter to ask "[do we need a different fancy name to define what should be just good design?](https://twitter.com/designoutloud/status/1180610292482396160)".

I think **it will help rise awareness** of such good principles, just like [AJAX](https://web.archive.org/web/20050223021343/http://adaptivepath.com:80/publications/essays/archives/000385.php) (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML) made XMLHTTPRequest mainstream, [RWD](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/) (Responsive Web Design) accelerated adoption of CSS Media Queries and fluid layouts, and [PWA](https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/) (Progressive Web App) more recently helped people discover the Web is not so far from native apps features.
