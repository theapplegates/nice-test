Even if I follow Max' work and content, I don't remember reading this article back in June. Thanks David for your article "[Publier](https://larlet.fr/david/stream/2019/12/10/)" (in French), where you shared the link, it resonates with me.

I've published [only one article this year](/articles/2019/). I'm not able to decide if I didn't write more because I don't take the time to write down the many ideas I have every day, or if the events this specific article relates touched me more than I'm able to acknowledge.

I should follow Max example:

> I’ll publish something as soon as I feel confident that all the important points I want to get across are there. I try to ignore the voice screaming “it’s not ready” just for long enough to push it online. Then I share the link on Twitter.

But even if I'm able to share [links](/links/), oddly even give [talks](/talks/), I feel articles I could write are not useful enough to justify taking time to write them. I don't have these "important points I want to get across". What is "Good Enough"?

Maybe writing 2 or 3 posts per year is enough, after all, if they are useful.

I'm even considering deleting a lot of old content from this site…
