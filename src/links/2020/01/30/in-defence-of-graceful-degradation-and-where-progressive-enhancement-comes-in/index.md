Interesting explanation about graceful degradation not being the opposite of progressive enhancement.

> Graceful degradation is an integral part of designing resilient, fault-tolerant systems.
>
> Despite the common narrative, graceful degradation is not in competition with progressive enhancement—it’s simply an approach that makes JavaScript degrade gracefully, like HTML and CSS do by default.
> 
> Graceful degradation and progressive enhancement have the same objective—to create robust, accessible and broad-reaching solutions that work for everyone no matter their choice of browser.
